# eesti.chat visual system

## Direction

An official, editorial state-portal interface: precise typography, thin rules, confident blue, and generous white space. The home page opens with an ivory editorial hero whose ask bar is pinned to the viewport bottom and stays there while scrolling; all other public surfaces remain light. The /app workspace is operational and quiet, with the same blue system carried through active states and focus.

## Type

Headlines use the local Aino headline face. Body text uses local Aino regular/bold/italic faces. No external font requests.

## Shape and depth

Cards use 6px corners, controls use 4px corners, and chips use 3px corners. Borders are 1px. Shadows are limited to `shadow-sm`-scale utility for small overlays only.

## Responsive behavior

Public pages collapse to a single column below 768px. The chat workspace preserves its existing fixed mobile drawers, overlays, and z-index hierarchy.

## Logo & icons

The mark is a talking stone: an Estonian-blue block with 16-unit radii and one square corner (bottom-left), holding a geometric white e. The header, footer and workspace use the horizontal lockup (`utils/brand.py` `Wordmark()`), and assistant replies use the mark as their avatar. Icons are a 24 px, 2 px-stroke outline set (`Icon(name)`), and most leave one small opening in the outline. Chat bubbles are 16 px stones whose square corner points at the speaker: ice for the user, white with a border for the assistant. The full kit and its rules are in `static/brand/README.md`.
